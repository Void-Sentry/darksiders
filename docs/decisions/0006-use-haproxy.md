# HAProxy

## Purpose
Reverse proxy and load balancer for all backend services.

## Why HAProxy?
- High-performance TCP/HTTP load balancer.
- Fine-grained control over routing.
- Widely supported and battle-tested in production environments.

## Use Cases
- Route frontend and API requests to appropriate services.
- Handle TLS termination.
- Implement failover and health checks.

## Justification Summary
HAProxy is a proven solution for service ingress in bare-metal or VM environments. It provides advanced configuration capabilities not always available in simpler reverse proxies.
