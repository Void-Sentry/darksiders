# Zitadel

## Purpose
Manages user authentication and identity, including JWT issuance and OAuth flows.

## Why Zitadel?
- Open-source and feature-rich identity provider.
- Supports OIDC, OAuth2, MFA, and user management out-of-the-box.
- Easily integrable with frontend (Next.js) and backend services.

## Justification Summary
Zitadel replaces the need for custom auth logic. Its standard protocols ensure security and simplify user management. Being a single instance is acceptable in this context due to its role and fault-tolerant nature.
